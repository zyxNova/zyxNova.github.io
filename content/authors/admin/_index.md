I am pursuing a B.E. in computer science at Zhejiang University, where I placed **first among 81 peers in the "mixed class" honors program, with a GPA of 93.84% (4.0/4.0)**. 

During my undergraduate, I actively conducted three research projects on generative modeling. I had the privilege of undertaking a research internship at MIT CSAIL under [Prof. Tommi Jaakkola](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tommi/tommi.html). I am very fortunate to collaborate with Ph.D. students [Yilun Xu](https://yilun-xu.com/) from MIT and [Yuanqi Du](https://yuanqidu.github.io/) from Cornell. Before that, I valued the mentorship of [Prof. Yingcai Wu](http://www.ycwu.org/) and [Prof. Xiao Xie](https://ssxiexiao.github.io/) on visualizations of causal inference at ZJU.

Currently, my research interests lie in developing and applying interpretable, controllable, and efficient generative modeling methods to facilitate advancements in vision-language(mainly text-to-image) generation and scientific discovery(e.g. 2D/3D molecule generation).

Feel free to contact me at [bearzy@zju.edu.cn](mailto:bearzy@zju.edu.cn) or [zyxiong@mit.edu](mailto:zyxiong@mit.edu) if you'd like to chat!
